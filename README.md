# Standalone Components

Inspired by Realworld example app named [Conduit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld). Rewrite with Angular 14 using Standalone Components, state management by @Ngrx/component-store

Thank Chau Tran (nartc) for sharing the way to imagine how Angular with standalone components look like in a project

# General Architecture of the app
- All Components was defined with property `standalone: true`
- State management with @ngrx/component-store
- TailwindCSS was chosen as CSS Framework
- Follow the spec & API from [Realwolrd](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

# How to run the project?
- Clone this repository.
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

*This Project is for applying new features of Angular 14
